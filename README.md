This repo contains supporting material for my talk about the very basics of Computer Vision with TensorFlow by example. You can check out [talks.md](talks.md) to know more about 
the talks I have given about this and also take a look at the slides 
<a href="http://bit.ly/cv-tf-slides"><img src="images/speakerdeck_button.svg" height="20"></a>. Please consider giving this repo a :star: if this is helpful to you!

## About the Notebooks

### [`fashion-mnist.ipynb`](fashion-mnist.ipynb)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/Design-and-Code-2020/blob/master/fashion-mnist.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/Design-and-Code-2020/HEAD?filepath=fashion-mnist.ipynb)

In this tutorial you will see how you can create a simple CNN to create an image classification algorithm with the Fashion MNIST Dataset. We will be using Keras, a high level 
abstraction so you can very easily get started on making your first CNN.

### [`cats-vs-dogs.ipynb`](cats-vs-dogs.ipynb)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Rishit-dagli/Design-and-Code-2020/blob/master/cats-vs-dogs.ipynb)
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Rishit-dagli/Design-and-Code-2020/HEAD?filepath=cats-vs-dogs.ipynb)

In this notebook you will create your first Computer Vision based Deep Learning model to classify between cats and dogs with TensorFlow. We will use the dogs-vs-cats dataset which 
is open-sourced. We will create a simple 2 class binary CNN to do so. You wil see all the aspects of training such a model, data preprocressing, the actual model, reducing 
overfitting and finally making inferences.
